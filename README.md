# 3D Game Engine

This is a 3D game engine written in C++. It is still under development, but it currently supports the following features:

*   3D rendering
*   A simple scene graph
*   A material system
*   A camera system
*   A windowing system

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have the following installed:

*   A C++ compiler
*   CMake
*   SDL2

Once you have these installed, you can build the engine by running the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

To run the engine, you can run the following command:

```
./build/main
```

This will open a window with a 3D cube.
