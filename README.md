# 3D Game Engine

This is a 3D game engine written in C++. It is still under development, but it currently supports the following features:

*   **Sistema de Renderizado 3D:** The core of the engine, capable of rendering graphics in three dimensions.
*   **Sistema de Escena (Scene Graph):** To organize and manage objects in the game world.
*   **Sistema de Materiales:** Allows defining and applying different materials to 3D objects.
*   **Sistema de CÃ¡mara:** Controls the player's view in the 3D world.
*   **Sistema de Ventanas:** Manages the creation and handling of the application window.
*   **Editor Integrado (usando ImGui):** A user interface to interact with the engine and edit game content.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have the following installed:

*   A C++ compiler (g++)
*   Make
*   SDL2

Once you have these installed, you can build the engine by running the following command:

```

```

## Usage

To run the engine, you can run the following command:

This will open a window with the editor.
